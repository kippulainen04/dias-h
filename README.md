## üöÄ Overview
Dais-h is an e-commercial React web application implementing ReactJs, React router, Redux & Firebase, along with the real payment gateway Stripe. Redux in this project plays a vital role as a global state management. With Redux, we can easily read and update the state in the whole tree of application, by using React hooks. Firebase additionally is used to store and retrieve user info and product's data by doing CRUD requrest to the endpoint of backend.

In this project, besides **[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)**, and **[ReactJs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))**, **Redux** is applied to empower the  Flux- architecture to make state management easier. The idea is to separate the state into its own components from React components for a better folder/file structures. **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** as a **Baas ([Backend As A Service](https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/4992-what-is-baas.html))** provides a means to link the UI and client-side logic to the backend provided as `Authentication, Firestore Database, Storage and so on`. Additionally, **[Progressive Web Application](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)** is applied to help us measuring the quality of the web app.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

After fulfilling the project, I acquire knowledge to:
* Build and style dynamic webpages with semantic **HTML** and **CSS** and **Javascript** with **ReactJs** library on top
* Use **Eslint** to check nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Configure **Stripe** payment gateway and **Firebase** of Google cloud services
* Implement the use of ReactJs for DOM manipulation and minify the files of our project with the help of Webpack from `create-react-app`
* Implement the use of **Material UI, Sass and styled-component** and **Google font**, to advance the styling of the project and implement **Google's Material Design** concept
* Implement **SCSS extenstion** styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets and inline/nesting styles to make 3D popping up for characters
* Implement the use of `.jsx` extension to build reuseable component for user interfact, along with `React hooks`
* Implement the use of **CRUD** requests to the **Bass** service, along with `async/await` to retrieve data from Firebase
* Perform common commands via the command line to interface with the operating system, such as navigating the file tree and creating, opening and comitting the file and directory to github
* Use **Git workflow** to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Execute live deployment using **GitHub** Pages
